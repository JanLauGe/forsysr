## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

The _prioritizr R_ package uses mixed integer linear programming (MILP) techniques to provide a flexible interface for building and solving conservation planning problems. It supports a broad range of objectives, constraints, and penalties that can be used to custom-tailor conservation planning problems to the specific needs of a conservation planning exercise. Once built, conservation planning problems can be solved using a variety of commercial and open-source exact algorithm solvers. In contrast to the algorithms conventionally used to solve conservation problems, such as heuristics or simulated annealing, the exact algorithms used here are guaranteed to find optimal solutions. Furthermore, conservation problems can be constructed to optimize the spatial allocation of different management actions or zones, meaning that conservation practitioners can identify solutions that benefit multiple stakeholders. Finally, this package has the functionality to read input data formatted for the _Marxan_ conservation planning program, and find much cheaper solutions in a much shorter period of time than _Marxan_.

## Installation

The latest official version of the _prioritizr R_ package can be installed from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/) using the following _R_ code.

Alternatively, the latest development version can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/prioritizr/prioritizr) using the following code. Please note that while developmental versions may contain additional features not present in the official version, they may also contain coding errors.

## Usage

Here we will provide a short example showing how the _prioritizr R_ package can be used to build and solve conservation problems. For brevity, we will use one of the built-in simulated datasets that is distributed with the package. First, we will load the _prioritizr R_ package.

We will use the sim_pu_polygons object to represent our planning units. Although the _prioritizr R_ can support many different types of planning unit data, here our planning units are represented as polygons in a spatial vector format (i.e. `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`). Each polygon represents a different planning unit and we have r length(sim_pu_polygons) planning units in total. The attribute table associated with this dataset contains information describing the acquisition cost of each planning ("cost" column), and a value indicating if the unit is already located in protected area ("locked_in" column). Let's explore the planning unit data.
