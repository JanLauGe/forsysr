## Scenario planning for restoration and fuel treatments

ForSys is a flexible platform for exploring landscape management scenarios and optimizing decisions in terms of where and how to achieve landscape restoration and fuel management goals. The model is spatially explicit and uses multi-criteria prioritization and optimization created to rapidly design fuel treatment and restoration scenarios. The program evolved from the Landscape Treatment Designer used in prior studies. The program has been used in several research and applied case studies at a range of scales (projects, forests, states, continental United States) to prioritize projects and stand treatments (see case studies). ForSys is available in a windows desktop (ForSysX) and R version (ForSysR).

## Installation

The latest official version of the _forsysr_ package can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/forsys-sp/forsysr/) using the following code. Please note that while developmental versions may contain additional features not present in the official version, they may also contain coding errors.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("forsys-sp/forsysr")
```

## Citation

Please cite the _forsysr_ package when using it in publications. To cite the latest official version, please use:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis", comment = ""}
cat(paste0("> Evers C, Houtman R, Day M, Belavenutti P, Lankston R, and Ager A. (",format(Sys.time(), "%Y"),"). ForSysR: Systematic Project Planning and Prioritization in R. R package version 0.9. Available at https://github.com/forsys-sp/forsysr.\n"))
```

## Usage

Here we will provide a short example showing how the _forsysr_ package can be used to build and solve a simple multi-objective restoration and fuel management problems. For brevity, we will use one of the built-in simulated datasets that is distributed with the package. First, we will load the _forsysr_ package.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# load package
library(forsys)
```

Although the _forsysr_ can support many different types of planning unit data, here our planning units are represented as polygons in a spatial vector format. Each polygon represents a different planning unit. 

```{r, out.width=ow}
# load planning unit data
data(test_forest)
# show the first rows in the attribute table
head(test_forest)
# plot the planning units
plot(test_forest[,c(4:5,7:10)], border=NA)
```

### Preparing the scenario config file

ForSys is easiest to run by referencing a text file saved using json notation.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
forsys::run(config_file = 'configs/test_forest_config.json')
```

The json config file provides a simple way to save and specify parameters for running ForSys. These parameters can be pass directly within the function. See `help(forsys::run)` for the complete arguments

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cat(readLines('configs/test_forest_config.json'), sep='\n')
```

### Running forsysr

ForSys prioritizing projects by maximizing an objective given one or more constraints. The objective represent one or more priorities while the constraints may include a maximum cost or area treated. Thresholds can be set to specify either to define the study area (e.g., a particular ownership) or based on requirements for treatment (e.g., minimum forest cover). ForSys then builds projects and ranks them in order of their priority. Projects can either predefined units or can be built dynamically.

Let's set up a very simple ForSys run to see how things work. We'll use the test_forest data shown above. We want to find the top 2000 ha within each project based on 'priority1')

```{r, fig.height=3}
plot(test_forest[,c('proj_id','priority1')], border=NA)
```

We run forsys within the following arguments. Remember that these can also be run using the json config file, as described above. Forsys always writes its outputs to csv files saved within the output folder, but we can optionally set it to write that data out to a list which has three elements containing the outputs.

```{r, message=F}
stand_dat <- test_forest %>% st_drop_geometry()

run_outputs <- forsys::run(
  return_outputs = TRUE,
  scenario_name = "test_scenario",
  stand_data = stand_dat,
  stand_id_field = "stand_id",
  proj_id_field = "proj_id",
  stand_area_field = "area_ha",
  scenario_priorities = "priority1",
  scenario_output_fields = c("area_ha", "priority1", "priority2", "priority3", "priority4"),
  proj_fixed_target =  TRUE,
  proj_target_field = "area_ha",
  proj_target_value = 2000
)

```
Not surprisingly, the treatment rank of the projects selected correspond directly to those areas where stands with those priorities are highest.

```{r, message=F, fig.height=3}
plot_dat <- test_forest %>%
  group_by(proj_id) %>% summarize() %>%
  left_join(run_outputs$project_output %>% select(proj_id, treatment_rank))
plot(plot_dat[,'treatment_rank'])

```

Below we plot the stands rather than the project area and only retain those stands that were treated.

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.height = 3}
plot_dat_2 <- test_forest %>%
  select(stand_id, proj_id) %>%
  inner_join(run_outputs$stand_output %>% select(stand_id, ETrt_YR)) %>%
  left_join(run_outputs$project_output %>% select(proj_id, treatment_rank))
  plot(plot_dat_2[,'treatment_rank'], border=NA)
```

### Multiple priorities 

Next we look at multiple priorities. Plotting priorities 1 and 2 shows that areas where priority 1 is highest tend to be lower for priority 2.

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.height=3}
plot(test_forest[,c('priority1','priority2')], border=NA)
```
We prioritize on a new variable called priority_12 which is the product of priorities 1 and 2. The resulting graph of treatment rank represents areas that are highest in both priorities.

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.height=3}
stand_dat_3 <- stand_dat %>% mutate(priority_12 = priority1 * priority2)
run_outputs_3 = forsys::run(
  return_outputs = TRUE,
  scenario_name = "test_scenario",
  stand_data = stand_dat_3,
  stand_id_field = "stand_id",
  proj_id_field = "proj_id",
  stand_area_field = "area_ha",
  scenario_priorities = "priority_12",
  scenario_output_fields = c("area_ha", "priority1", "priority2", "priority3", "priority4"),
  proj_fixed_target =  TRUE,
  proj_target_field = "area_ha",
  proj_target_value = 2000
)

plot_dat_3 <- test_forest %>%
  group_by(proj_id) %>% summarize() %>%
  left_join(run_outputs_3$project_output %>% select(proj_id, treatment_rank))
plot(plot_dat_3[,'treatment_rank'])

```
We expand on this scenario further by limiting stand selection to a single ownership.

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.height=3}

run_outputs_4 = forsys::run(
  return_outputs = TRUE,
  scenario_name = "test_scenario",
  stand_data = stand_dat_3,
  stand_id_field = "stand_id",
  proj_id_field = "proj_id",
  stand_area_field = "area_ha",
  stand_threshold = "ownership == 2",
  scenario_priorities = "priority_12",
  scenario_output_fields = c("area_ha", "priority1", "priority2", "priority3", "priority4"),
  proj_fixed_target =  TRUE,
  proj_target_field = "area_ha",
  proj_target_value = 2000
)

plot_dat_4 <- test_forest %>%
  group_by(proj_id) %>% summarize() %>%
  left_join(run_outputs_4$project_output %>% select(proj_id, treatment_rank = treatment_rank)) 
plot(plot_dat_4[,'treatment_rank'])

```

### Exploring different project selection methods

Forsys can build projects dynamically using a feature called patchmax, which requires some additional arguments.

```{r, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
# first we need to create an object describing stand adjacency
adj = Patchmax::calculate_adj(test_forest, St_id = test_forest$stand_id, method='nb')

run_outputs_5 = forsys::run(
  return_outputs = TRUE,
  stand_data = stand_dat_3,
  scenario_name = "patchmax_test",
  stand_id_field = "stand_id",
  proj_id_field = "proj_id",
  stand_area_field = "area_ha",
  scenario_priorities = "priority1",
  stand_threshold = "ownership == 2",
  scenario_output_fields = c("area_ha", "priority1", "priority2", "priority3", "priority4"),
  scenario_output_grouping_fields = "ownership",
  run_with_patchmax = TRUE,
  patchmax_stnd_adj = adj,
  patchmax_proj_size = 50000,
  patchmax_proj_number = 10,
  patchmax_sample_n = 1000
)

plot_dat_5 <- run_outputs_5$stand_output %>% mutate(treatment_rank = proj_id)
plot_dat_5 <- test_forest %>% left_join(plot_dat_5 %>% select(stand_id, treatment_rank)) %>%
  group_by(treatment_rank) %>% summarize()
plot(plot_dat_5[,'treatment_rank'], border=NA)
```
