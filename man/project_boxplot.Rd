project_boxplot(results_data, proj_field, x_field, y_field, constraint_field)
}
\arguments{
\item{results_data}{The results data frame}

\item{proj_field}{The planning area or project ID}

\item{x_field}{The NAME of the first priority. This will be the filter for
weight, and will add ETrt_*_PCP to access the value field}

\item{y_field}{The NAME of the secondary priority. This will be used to
rank projects between weighting scenarios}

\item{constraint_field}{Field used to constrain simulation. Usually some
form of area.}

\item{priority}{The NAME of the main priority. This will be the filter for
weight, and will add ETrt_*_PCP to access the value field}
